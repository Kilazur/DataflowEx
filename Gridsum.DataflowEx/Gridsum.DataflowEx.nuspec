    <summary>Gridsum's dataflow framework built upon TPL Dataflow</summary>
    <description>
      Gridsum.DataflowEx is a high-level dataflow framework redesigned on top of Microsoft TPL Dataflow library with Object-Oriented Programming in mind.
      DataflowEx enables you to write reusable components and easily link them together as a high-level graph while still having the power of low level blocks from TPL Dataflow. Other cool features include: Dataflow lifecycle management, built-in dataflow health monitor, cyclic graph auto completion support, sql bulk insertion support, etc. Find more at https://github.com/gridsum/dataflowex.
